Joey,

Your flarf poem was very interesting and I'm glad you decided to submit this, rather than a more 'serious' version you had mentioned earlier. 
The 'manosphere' worshipping narrator your poem follows rides the line of seriousness and satire very well. The utilization of the word, "literally"
helps to assist in the absurdity of the hyperlinks that are attached. As I read this, it makes me chuckle while also feel sad that there are 
certain individuals who idiolize people like 'Patrick Bateman' unironically. Great work!
