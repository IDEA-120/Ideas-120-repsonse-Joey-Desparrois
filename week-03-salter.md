After completing the reading from Salter, he mentions the term "c."
Generally, a Gesamtkunstwerk makes use of multiple art forms or attempts to do so.
Something that i consider to be a Gesamtkunstwerk is a TV.
Televison has come a long way and especially how large and slim they have become over the years looking like a frame on the wall.
The user, is choosing what they want to project onto the screen by using modern technology
They can show all kinds of colors and patterns by using the thousands if not millions of different pixels.
And since the user has control over what they want to have on the tv, they can watch different movies/shows and can view different genres of media.
So in my opinion, a TV can be considered a "Gesamtkunstwerk."
