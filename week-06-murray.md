Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments to me were successful.
I think that it is amazing that she was able to see the future of technology for television. 
For example she mentioned that technology would be more interactive for the user. 
This was correct because now for example, if given to the viewer, they are able to interact with few tv shows and movies and sometimes they can make it a "choose your own adventure" story.
Murrays prediction works for The Mandalorian because now the actors on set can visuallize where they are instead of having to imagine it. 
Because of using giant L.E.D. screens instead of green screens this can put the actor more into the zone and allow them to get into character more.
This allows for both the actors and the viewers to be more immersed in what they are watching on television.
