Reading James Bridle's article, I can clearly understand his desire to hold YouTube and Google responsible for the content they host.
He mainly discusses the issues of children using the internet and how it can be traumatizing or how they are being used for revenue.
Youtube Kids is a pretty weird site with all the odd videos such as surprise eggs or the weird 3d nursery rhymes. 
When i was a kid i aswell grew up watching Youtube and i enjoyed the content that came out most of the time. Ocassionally there would be a jumpscare video here and there but it didnt outweigh the better moments.
I would not watch peppa pig (even though it wasnt out at the time) i would usually watch lets play videos from channels such as PewDiePie.
Now i see young cousins or children at work blasting videos from youtube kids and it just feels odd seeing the videos they are watching. 
Youtube content back then used to be original and now everything is copied from channel to channel. All these toy channels are the same as the next and they do this because they know they can make a profit out of children.
James then proposed an idea where that the internet should be a safe space and be meant for users to show their own creativity. While i agree with this statement, i do not believe itll get to that point where its only used for good.
